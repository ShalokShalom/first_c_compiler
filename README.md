# PDP-11/UNIX C Compiler by Dennis Richie (1972)

The earliest versions of the very first C compiler, known to exist in the wild written by the Dennis Richie himself. 

These are not capable of being compiled today with modern C compilers like GCC, however, in theory it's possible to buld it using PDP-11/UNIX emulator.
