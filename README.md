# PDP-11/UNIX C Compiler by Dennis Richie (1972)

The earliest versions of the very first C compiler, known to be written by the Dennis Richie himself.

It's not possible to compile it nowadays with any modern C compilers like GCC, however, in theory there's a probability of success compiling it using PDP-11/UNIX emulator.
